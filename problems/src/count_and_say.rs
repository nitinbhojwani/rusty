// https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/
/// The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
/// 1.     1
/// 2.     11
/// 3.     21
/// 4.     1211
/// 5.     111221
/// 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
/// 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
/// 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
/// 
/// Given an integer n where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. 
/// You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.
/// Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
